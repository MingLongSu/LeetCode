    "> - Note that this problem involves buying and selling, and of course you cannot sell a stock without first purchasing it\n",
    "> - This means that we may be able to deploy a double pointer, one to denote the purchase date and one to denote the selling date\n",
    "> - According to the question, the max profit made can only be 0, and so we should initially set the max profit amount to 0\n",
    "> - If the price at the buy date is more than then price at the sell date then we should move the buy date in hopes of getting a smaller buying price\n",
    "> - Otherwise, we just move the sell date, in hopes of finding a max profit"
