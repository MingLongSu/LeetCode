    "> - Note that this problem involves buying and selling, and of course you cannot sell a stock without first purchasing it\n",
    "> - This means that we may be able to deploy a double pointer, one to denote the purchase date and one to denote the selling date\n",
    "> - According to the question, the max profit made can only be 0, and so we should initially set the max profit amount to 0\n",
    "> - If the price at the buy date is more than then price at the sell date then we should move the buy date in hopes of getting a smaller buying price\n",
    "> - Otherwise, we just move the sell date, in hopes of finding a max profit"

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need two pointers, which represent the buy and sell dates (one at the start of the time and one at the end)\n",
    "> - While the buy date is less than the selling date, we move through the array to update the max profit from price[sell_date] - price[buy_date]\n",
    "> - We only move the buy date when the price at buy date is more than price at sell date, and otherwise, we move the sell date\n",
    "> - Then we return the max profit"
