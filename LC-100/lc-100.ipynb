    "> - Note that the number of nodes can range between 0-100 inclusive; one assumption to make is that an empty tree is passed as undefined\n",
    "> - Note that when we traverse the tree, the left and right of the parent node becomes the parent node at each iteration\n",
    "> - When is a tree the same? Well, when all nodes are matching - but when do all the nodes match, they all match if every iteration reaches undefined at the same time\n",
    "> - As edge cases, note that if node reaches undefined before another, then they are not identical trees\n",
    "> - Similarly, if the values are different for a node between p and q, then p and q are also not identical trees"
