    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need a hashmap to store the key-value pairs for frequency of numbers\n",
    "> - We need a list to append all intersecting digits\n",
    "> - First, we check which array is larger, if the second is larger, then nums1 should point to nums2\n",
    "> - We then add all values in nums1 to a hashmap, and record the frequencies for each number\n",
    "> - Then we check if any values in nums2 are in the hashmap with O(1) lookup \n",
    ">   - If a element of the num2 array is present in the hashmap, then we decrement the frequency counter (to prevent over counting of intersecting numbers) and append it to the returning array"
