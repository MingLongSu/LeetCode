    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Similar to LeetCode 392, a word is only a subsequence of s if the letters in words[i] are in s and maintain the same ordering\n",
    "> - The length of each word will always be at least 1 letter long, and there will always be at least 1 word in the words array\n",
    "> - Each word in the words array and s consist of only lowercase English letters\n",
    "> - Noticeably, the words array is quite long, and so we may have to consider more efficient algorithms"
