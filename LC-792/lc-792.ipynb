    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Similar to LeetCode 392, a word is only a subsequence of s if the letters in words[i] are in s and maintain the same ordering\n",
    "> - The length of each word will always be at least 1 letter long, and there will always be at least 1 word in the words array\n",
    "> - Each word in the words array and s consist of only lowercase English letters\n",
    "> - Noticeably, the words array is quite long, and so we may have to consider more efficient algorithms\n",
    "> - We have to return the number of strings that are subsequences to s"

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example, there are 3 subsequences to s since \"a\", \"acd\", and \"ace\" all consist of letters that are ordered consistently with s and have letters from s\n",
    "> - The same can be said for example 2\n",
    "> - Since we are dealing with 1 to 5000 possible words per test case, we need to determine a better way for checking whether a word is a subsequence to s\n",
    "> - Although using a hashmap to store the amount of appearances per letter is good idea, it fails at satisfying the condition for subsequences to also consider order of the letters\n",
    "> - Since order matters, we could use a hashmap to store all the indices of each letter in string s\n",
    "> - Then, for each word, and each letter, if that letter is present in the hashmap, then we need to find the next smallest index in order\n",
    "> - But if the result of looking for the next index comes out to be out of bounds for a particular letter, then it must be the case that it is not a subsequence\n",
    ">   - In addition, if a letter in words[i] is not in the hashmap, then the word must also not be a subsequence of string s\n",
    "> - Otherwise, if every letter can be found in the string s, in order, and not out of bounds, then we it must be true that the word is a subsequence"
