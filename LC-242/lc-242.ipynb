    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Note that anagrams are words that both utilise the same type of letters and amount of such letters\n",
    "> - s and t, which are strings, will only consist of English letters\n",
    "> - Since this is a verification problem concerning count of letters without the need to consider order, a potentially good route to follow is making use of hashmaps\n",
    "> - Note also that s and t definitely cannot be anagrams if they are strings of different length, since different-lengthed strings completely break the rule of being anagrams to one another"

    "> - Utilising the idea of a hashmap, we can use a hashmap to store key-value pairs where the keys are the letters themselves and the values are the frequencies of each letter\n",
    "> - Then, moving through the letters of one hashmap, we can then begin to verify whether s and t are anagrams to one another:\n",
    ">   - if a letter is found in s but not in t, then s and t cannot be anagrams\n",
    ">   - if the frequency of a letter in s does not match with the frequency of a letter in t, then s and t will also not be anagrams\n",
    "> - Through this heuristic algorithm, we notice that s and t are anagrams for example 1 because they match in both the type of letters used and the quantity of such letters used\n",
    "> - As for example 2, it is false because the letter 't' appears in string s but not in the string t\n",

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We first check if strings s and t are of the same length, if they are not the same length, then we immediately return False to indicate s and t are not anagrams\n",
    "> - We need two hashmaps, each hashmap to store the frequency of letters in s and t, respectively\n",
    "> - We then traverse through the keys of the hashmap of s and check the following:\n",
    ">   - Whether a letter of s is in t and whether that frequency matches with the frequency found in t, if either fail, then return False to indicate that s and t are not anagrams\n",
    "> - Otherwise, after that entire process, return True to indicate that s and t are valid anagrams"

    "> - Note that, in the worse case scenario where every letter is unique, we traverse the array at most 2(S + T) times where S and T are the lengths of strings s and t, respectively. Therefore, this algorithms time complexity is O(2(S + T)), or more simply, O(S + T)\n",
