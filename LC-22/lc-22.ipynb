    "> - We aren't generating all possible combinations of parenthesis, but rather, all combinations of valid parenthesis pairs\n",
    "> - Something that might be important to keep track of is the count on the number of opening and closing braces used\n",
    "> - To find all possible combinations, something that could be attempted is recursion, but what might be the base cases? \n",
    "> - If also recursive, we could use a string to represent the parentheses combinations, but that would mean that we must also pass a string as a param? \n",
    "> - Oddly enough, the number of paranthesis pairs minimises at 1 and maximises at 8."

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - Noticeably, since we are only finding all the VALID combinations of parentheses, that means it's entirely allowed to start with an opening parenthesis \"(\"\n",
    "> - That means when keeping track of the count on the opening parentheses, the number of opening parenthesis will initially be 1, while closing is initially 0\n",
    "> - Earlier, I proposed using a string, this would mean that we have to pass it as a parameter to the recursive function, is there a way to avoid this?\n",
    ">   - Actually, yes, we could just make use of a Stack so that our recursive function only keeps track of the count on # of opening and # of closing parentheses\n",
    ">   - We just need to pop off the most recently added parenthesis type after each iteration\n",
    "> - Since we are going with recursion, we need base cases:\n",
    ">   - if open == closing == n, then combinations.append(...), where open and closing are the # of opening and # of closing parenthesis, respectively. Moreover, combinations is just the valid results\n",
    ">   - if open < n, then we can recurse for when we add an opening parenthesis (increment open by 1) and recurse for when we add a closing parenthesis (increment closing by 1)\n",
    ">   - if closing < open, then add a closing parenthesis and increment closing by 1"

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need a list called \"combinations\" to store the results of the combinations\n",
    "> - We need a list called \"stack\" to behave as our stack data structure for building the combinations of brackets, and initialise it with a single opening brace since valid cannot start with closing\n",
    "> - Using a recursive function called \"build_combos,\" it takes in the number of opening braces and the number of closing braces presently in the stack\n",
    "> - As for base cases:\n",
    ">   - if open == close == n, then append that combo to \"combinations\" \n",
    ">   - if open < n then we add a open parenthesis and call recurse and then pop \n",
    ">       - Unlike in the notes earlier, we don't actually need to add a closing parenthesis because this could actually lead to situations like \"())\", which is undesired\n",
    ">   - if close < open, then add a closing parenthesis and increment closing by 1 (this is mainly to match up with any remaining opening braces that may be unmatched)\n",
    "> - Finally, we return the combinations"

    "> ### Final Verdict\n",
    "> - Note that we can go almost two directions with each iterations, for example \"()()()\" as a valid string, this gives gives us O(2^2n) time complexity. As for space complexity, we make use of the stack O(2^2n) times in the worst case scenario. Hence a space complexity of O(2^2n)"
