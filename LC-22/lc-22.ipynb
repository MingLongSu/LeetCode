    "> - Something that might be important to keep track of is the count on the number of opening and closing braces used\n",
    "> - To find all possible combinations, something that could be attempted is recursion, but what might be the base cases? \n",
    "> - If also recursive, we could use a string to represent the parentheses combinations, but that would mean that we must also pass a string as a param? \n",
    "> - Oddly enough, the number of paranthesis pairs minimises at 1 and maximises at 8."

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - Noticeably, since we are only finding all the VALID combinations of parentheses, that means it's entirely allowed to start with an opening parenthesis \"(\"\n",
    "> - That means when keeping track of the count on the opening parentheses, the number of opening parenthesis will initially be 1, while closing is initially 0\n",
    "> - Earlier, I proposed using a string, this would mean that we have to pass it as a parameter to the recursive function, is there a way to avoid this?\n",
    ">   - Actually, yes, we could just make use of a Stack so that our recursive function only keeps track of the count on # of opening and # of closing parentheses\n",
    ">   - We just need to pop off the most recently added parenthesis type after each iteration\n",
    "> - Since we are going with recursion, we need base cases:\n",
    ">   - if open == closing == n, then combinations.append(...), where open and closing are the # of opening and # of closing parenthesis, respectively. Moreover, combinations is just the valid results\n",
    ">   - if open < n, then we can recurse for when we add an opening parenthesis (increment open by 1) and recurse for when we add a closing parenthesis (increment closing by 1)\n",
    ">   - if closing < open, then add a closing parenthesis and increment closing by 1"
