    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example 1, the largest sum achieved is from [4, -1, 2, 1] which is sum = 6. Notice that we can kind of think of the problem as a sliding window\n",
    "> - For example 2, this is an instance where we can simply return the first value since len(nums) == 1 is True\n",
    "> - For example 3, notice that, although there is a negative number between the positive numbers in the array, the largest contiguous array is the array itself. So perhaps we should only be bothered with resetting a sum when the sum is less than 0\n",
    "> - Simplifying the problem from a sliding window, we could think of it as a simple single pass problem if we can reset the sum\n",
    "> - Since there is at least one number in the list, \"nums,\" then the initial max should be set to nums[0]\n",
    "> - In order to update the max, we will have a sum that accumulates as it traverses and adds the elements in \"nums\", and if sum > the max sum, then we should update the max sum"

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need a variable to store the total as we traverse, \"total\"\n",
    "> - We need a variable to store the greatest total accumulatable from the subarrays, \"max_total\"\n",
    "> - If the length of nums is 1, then the greatest possible sum of a subarray of the array is the amount given by the first value of the array, so we return nums[0]\n",
    "> - \"total\" and \"max_total\" should both be initially set to nums[0] (since start of 0 would mean that, if the whole list had negative numbers, then max would be 0 albeit not existent in the array, \"nums\")\n",
    "> - As we traverse the array (we have to start from index 1 since we init'd with index 0), \"nums\":\n",
    ">   - if total is ever less than zero, then set total to 0\n",
    ">   - total should then be added by the value at nums[i] (where i is an index of the array)\n",
    ">   - Then, if total is greater than max_total, then we update max_total to total\n",
    "> - Finally, we return the value at max_total"
