    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - Since order of letters remains to be an important determining factor for whether s is a subsequence of t, we could consider traversing the s and t from their fronts\n",
    "> - In addition, we could have two pointers, one for string s and the other for string t\n",
    "> - Since we are checking for whether the letters in s are in t, then, with two pointers, we only need to update the pointer on s when a letter in s has been validated to be present in t\n",
    "> - And, since we are traversing both from the front, then this gurantees that we maintain the rule of order for subsequence validation"
