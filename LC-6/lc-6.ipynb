    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - A new string will be created by reading the zig zag row-wise\n",
    "> - From the example, note that there exists a correlation between the desired number of rows and how much you must jump in order to get the characters on each row\n",
    ">   - Particularly, you must jump by 2 * (numRows - 1)\n",
    ">   - From the fact that, for example on row 1: P = (0, 0), A = (1, 4), Y = (2, 8) -> where (x, y) is such that x is the index in the new string, and y is the position in the orignal string\n",
    "> - For rows that have more than one character on that row, it seems to be 2 away from the amount jumped "

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - From example 2, it seems to actually be that, if a row has a character in between a jump, then the position of such letter is row + jump - 2 * row; where jump = 2 * (numRows - 1)\n",
    "> - Since we incorporate the row + jump - 2 * row expression to find the position of the addition character in each iteration, then we only do such an opration when 0 < curr_row < numRows - 1\n",
    "> - Since we are using row + jump - 2 * row expression, then if we are at the first index of each row, then we also must make sure that the result of the expression is greater than 0"
