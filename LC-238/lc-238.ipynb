    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Notice that we are retuning an array of values that consist of numbers that are the products of all other numbers aside from the number originally at its index\n",
    "> - We may assume that the products do not lead to integer overflow and thus will not have to be concerned with that case\n",
    "> - There will always be at least 2 numbers in the array nums\n",
    "> - We must also write a solution in O(n) time and utilises O(1) space\n",
    "> - Of course, we could go through the array n^2 times and add the results of multiplication to their respective indices; however, this would have an O(n^2) time complexity which we don't want"

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example 1, notice that index 0 resolves to 24 = 2 * 3 * 4, index 1 resolves to 12 = 1 * 3 * 4 and so on...\n",
    "> - For example 2, the same pattern can be noticed\n",
    "> - Notice from the question that the question gives an almost missable but MAJOR HINT: suffix and prefix multiplication\n",
    "> - Notice that each index is equal to the product of all values on the left and all the values on the right\n",
    "> - Since we are working with multiplication, suppose we have an array with the same length as nums but all values of the array are filled with 1s initially; call this the results array\n",
    "> - This means that starting with some accumulator on the left = 1, we can traverse the array from left to right while multiplying each value in the results to the accumulated prefix\n",
    "> - While also updating the prefix value by multiplying the number at num for that index to it - this makes sense as this value would be a prefix to the value ahead of it\n",
    "> - A similar argument may be made about the postfix solution, and the multiplication will result in the correct output"
