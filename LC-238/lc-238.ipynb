    "> - Notice that we are retuning an array of values that consist of numbers that are the products of all other numbers aside from the number originally at its index\n",
    "> - We may assume that the products do not lead to integer overflow and thus will not have to be concerned with that case\n",
    "> - There will always be at least 2 numbers in the array nums\n",
    "> - We must also write a solution in O(n) time and utilises O(1) space\n",
    "> - Of course, we could go through the array n^2 times and add the results of multiplication to their respective indices; however, this would have an O(n^2) time complexity which we don't want"
