    "> - We must return an array of arrays of all unique combinations of numbers that sum to the target\n",
    ">   - That is, unique means that we do not want permutations that sum to target, but rather, combinations that sum to target\n",
    ">   - So the big question is, how can I eliminate the duplicates? To eliminate duplicates, I could try restricting the decision space or the candidates that I can choose from\n",
    ">   - Also, to find such combinations; perhaps the best way to start is to make use of a DFS approach\n",
    "> - Same numbers can be chosen unlimited numbers of times\n",
    "> - Number of unique combinations that sum up to the target value is less than 150 for all test cases\n",
    "> - Target is always at min 1\n",
    "> - The integers for the candidates are always greater than or equal to 1 but also less than or equal to 200"

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - Again, a naive approach to the problem would be to make use of DFS and simply find all the possible permutations; but that would never get the desired result since combinations are desired\n",
    "> - Instead, we have to modify the DFS approach to find all combinations while maintaining uniqueness - which could be managed by restricting the decision space\n",
    "> - Perhaps we could simplify the problem to two decisions\n",
    ">   - Simplify it to something such as: we either add a number or we don't and restrict the decision space by not being able to choose numbers before it either\n",
    ">   - From ex 2, note that [2, 2, 2, 2] is valid for a target of 8; then our decision can be to either add the same number as before or not and eventually move onto a new number\n",
    "> - We would need an array to store the numbers accumulated so far and a value to keep track of the current sum\n",
    "> - Since we are using DFS, then we'll also be using a recursive approach and so some conditions need to be set:\n",
    ">   - If the current sum is greater than the target or we have run out of numbers to add, then we should just return\n",
    ">   - If the current sum is equal to the target, then we should append a copy of the array of numbers and then return as well to exit the recursion\n",
    "> - In terms of how the DFS will explore, again, we move in two directions\n",
    ">   - One path (recursive call) will explore the situation where we add the same number\n",
    ">   - One path will explore the situation where we do not add the same number and move along to the next number"

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need a results array to store all the unique combinations of integers that sum to the target\n",
    "> - We need to create a DFS function with the following params:\n",
    ">   - curr_comb, which is the current combination path that we have\n",
    ">   - cutoff, which is the index the indicates where we want to restrict the decision space for \n",
    ">   - total, which is the current total accumulated from the numbers that are in cur_comb\n",
    "> - In the DFS, we have the following base cases:\n",
    ">   - if total > target or if cutoff == quantity of numbers in candidates, then we should exit this recursive call\n",
    ">   - if total == target, then we should append the current accumulated list of numbers to the results and exit this recursive call as well\n",
    "> - If none of the aforementioned conditions fire off, then we should first explore the possibility of adding the current element at the cutoff\n",
    "> - Then we should pop the most recently added element to curr_comb\n",
    "> - Then explore the option of moving the cutoff forward\n",
    "> - Then finally return the results array"
