    ">   - So the big question is, how can I eliminate the duplicates? To eliminate duplicates, I could try restricting the decision space or the candidates that I can choose from\n",
    ">   - Also, to find such combinations; perhaps the best way to start is to make use of a DFS approach\n",
    "> - Same numbers can be chosen unlimited numbers of times\n",
    "> - Number of unique combinations that sum up to the target value is less than 150 for all test cases\n",
    "> - Target is always at min 1\n",
    "> - The integers for the candidates are always greater than or equal to 1 but also less than or equal to 200"
