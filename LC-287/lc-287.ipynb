    "> - Note that the array includes n + 1 integers and each integer is in the range of [1, n]\n",
    "> - Note that it is also guaranteed that there will always be one repeated nummber in the array nums\n",
    "> - Of course, checking for a duplicate number can be easily done in O(n) time complexity with the help of hashmaps; however, the question asks that we solve the question in O(1) space complexity\n",
    "> - Of course, we could also opt for a double for loop solution or even sorting then using binary search to get time complexities of O(n^2) and O(nlogn), respectively, where n is the length of nums but, those seem too slow. \n",
    "> - Note that there will always be at least two numbers in the array since 1 <= n and nums.length == n + 1, hence nums.length <= 2\n",
    "> - Also, scratch the idea of sorting then using binary search since we are not allowed to modify the array \"nums\""
