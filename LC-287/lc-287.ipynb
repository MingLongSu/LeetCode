    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Note that the array includes n + 1 integers and each integer is in the range of [1, n]\n",
    "> - Note that it is also guaranteed that there will always be one repeated nummber in the array nums\n",
    "> - Of course, checking for a duplicate number can be easily done in O(n) time complexity with the help of hashmaps; however, the question asks that we solve the question in O(1) space complexity\n",
    "> - Of course, we could also opt for a double for loop solution or even sorting then using binary search to get time complexities of O(n^2) and O(nlogn), respectively, where n is the length of nums but, those seem too slow. \n",
    "> - Note that there will always be at least two numbers in the array since 1 <= n and nums.length == n + 1, hence nums.length <= 2\n",
    "> - Also, scratch the idea of sorting then using binary search since we are not allowed to modify the array \"nums\""

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For examples 1 and 2, it's very easy to notice that there repetitions for the numbers 2 and 3, respectively\n",
    "> - Thinking back to the constraints of the question, note that each number actually maps to an index of nums. Moreover, if we follow such a method of traversal in the array, we also begin to notice that the locations of the duplicates are also the locations of where cycles in occur\n",
    "> - Recalling to Floyd's Toroise and Hare algorithm, the algorithm itself is actually of O(n) time complexity and will determine the location of the cycles, thus the value of the duplicate"
