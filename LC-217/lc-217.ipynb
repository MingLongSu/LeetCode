    "> - Just return True so long as a number within the array reappears at least a second time\n",
    "> - Noticeably, the length of the list is relatively high\n",
    "> - Checking whether a number is in the list may be computationally inefficient as checking whether it appears again in the array is O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the list, nums\n",
    "> - We could add the numbers to a hashmap to then check whether a number reappears\n",
    ">   - That is, while traversing the list, we add numbers to the hashmap/hashset and if a number can be found in the hashmap/hashset, then it a duplicate is present"

    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example 1, note that if we use a hashmap/hashset, then by adding 1 to the hashmap/hashset, then by the time we reach the end of the list, we check if nums[3] = 1 is in the hashmap/hashlist. Noticeably, it's in the hashmap, therefore True would be returned and therefore it matches the output\n",
    "> - For example 2, even after adding all those values to the hashmap/hashset no numbers are repeated, therefore False is returned\n",
    "> - For example 3, it's True after detecting the 1's\n",
    "> - Note that reorganizing the list is an O(n) operation as well, but to speed up some computations, it may be more efficient to sort before utilising hashmap/hashsets"

    "> ### Final Verdict\n",
    "> - Note that we make use of a hashmap, and so all operations, including checking the hashmap, is an O(1) operation. Meanwhile, we traverse the list once, and so this gives a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, \"nums.\" In terms of space complexity, since we add at most n key-value pairs to the utilized hashmap, we get an overall space complexity of O(n)."
