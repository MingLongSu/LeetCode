    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example 1, the number at index 0 and 1 are the answers to the solution since (nums[0] = 2) + (nums[1] = 7) = 9\n",
    "> - Note that we return the solution as an array of the two numbers that sum to \"target\"\n",
    "> - Of course, the most simple solution would be to traverse the array using a double for loop; excusing elements that share the same index, and finding the element in the array that matches\n",
    ">   -  Or in other words, find a num[j] such that num[j] = target - num[i]\n",
    "> - However, there is definitely a more time efficient solution, but this solution sacrifices some memory as it will utilise a hashmap\n",
    "> - Particularly, the hashmap will consist of key-value pairs where the keys = target - num[i] and the values = i, and so if we come across a value that is in the hashmap, it's our desired second number to reach \"target\""

    "> - While traversing the array, we add the key-value pairs into the hashmap\n",

    "> ### Final Verdict\n",
    "> - Note that we end up traversing the array once, this is an O(n) process, where n is the length of array, \"nums.\" In addition, search the hashmap is an O(1) process and so the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n)\n",
    "> - In terms of the space complexity, in the worst case scenario, this could store n key-value pairs. Therefore, we arrive at an O(n) space complexity for this algorithm as well"
