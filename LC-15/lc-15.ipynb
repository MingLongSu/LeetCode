    "> - Note there will always be at least 3 elements \n",
    "> - The most obvious route to finding solutions for this would be to use a triple for-loop to find all the possible combinations; however, although it delivers constant space, the time complexity is O(N^3) where N is the length of the input array"

    "> - The order of the triplets does not matter, so long as they are unique triplets\n",
    "> - However, notice that the output triplets are in order from smallest to largest\n",
    "> - Notice that, unlike 2Sum, this question is not guaranteed to have a solution, and so an empty array is returned\n",
    "> - Notice that the following question can be summed up to \"find values a, b, and c such that a + b + c = 0\"\n",
    ">   - Then the question is simply a matter of finding b and c such that b + c = -a\n",
    ">   - Then this question becomes extremely similar to that of 2Sum where target = -a this time\n",
    ">   - However, since we do not want any repeats in the values for the triplets, then we could also sort the array before any operations are done: that way, if consecutive numbers in the array are the same, then we can skip them\n",
    ">   - Also, since i != j, i != k, and j != k. Specifically, since i != j and i != k, then we should also increment the pointers in those scenarios\n"

    "> - We then traverse the array where our target is the negative of the current element of traversal\n",
    "> - Then while the left pointer is at a lesser position than the right pointer:\n",
    ">   - We calculate a difference where difference = target - b\n",
    ">   - Check whether left pointer equals the position of the target's position or nums[right] < difference or if the nums[left - 1] == nums[left], if true, then increment up left by 1 \n",
    ">   - Check whether right pointer equals the position of the target's position or nums[right] > difference or if the nums[right + 1] == nums[right], if true, then increment down right by 1\n",
    ">   - Then, if nums[right] == difference is true, then append the array, [target_index, left, right]\n",
    "> - Finally, we return the results array"
