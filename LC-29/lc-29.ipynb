    "> ## Additional Notes\n",
    "> - Although this solution does work, it is particularly inefficient - sporting a time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the dividend. Moreover, this implementation actually exceeds the time limit for an acceptable submission by LeetCode's standards for exceptionally large integers. \n",
    "> - How might we find a solution that can be more efficient?\n",
    "> - Let's consider the common result of mathematics: all even integers = 2n, and all odd integers = 2m + 1, where n and m are some integers\n",
    "> - We can use a simliar idea where we double up on the divisor for each iteration to check how many integer groups are formed from dividend / divisor\n",
    "> - Consider 63 / 3:\n",
    ">   - So, this gives 63 >= 3 * 2^0 -> 63 >= 3 * 2^1 -> 63 >= 3 * 2^2 -> 63 >= 3 * 2^3 -> 63 >= 3 * 2^4 -> 63 IS NOT >= 3 * 2^5\n",
    ">   - In total, we have accumulated a total of 5 steps from this, and not going to include the last step since it is 63 < 3 * 2^5\n",
    ">   - While doubling the divisor to increase efficiency, then the amount of groups that can be made from the original divisor must also scale by the same 2^n factor, hence the quotient would be equal to 1 * 2^n; however, since the number of steps is 1 more than the number of slides, then slides = steps - 1, so the quotient = quotient + (1 << (steps - 1))\n",
    "> - Now, returning to the example of 63 / 3, of course, 63 / 3 != 1 * 2^(5-1) = 16, so we take what remains of 63 - 3 * 16 = 63 - 48 = 15\n",
    "> - The process then repeats by 15 >= 3 * 2^0 -> 15 >= 3 * 2^1 -> 15 >= 3 * 2^2 -> 15 IS NOT >= 3 * 2^3, this is then steps = 3 \n",
    "> - Slides = steps - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 and so quotient = quotient + 1 * 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20\n",
    "> - Now considering the remaining from 15 - 3 * (1 * 2^2) = 15 - 12 = 3\n",
    "> - The processs then repeats by 3 >= 3 * 2^0 -> 3 IS NOT >= 3 * 2^1, and so steps = 1, but slides = steps - 1 = 0\n",
    "> - So quotient = quotient + 1 * 2^0 = 20 + 1 = 21 and there we have the desired result of the integer division"
