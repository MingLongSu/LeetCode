    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging and utilising all original letters precisely once\n",
    ">   - This means that count of number for a particular letter is important \n",
    "> - We are dealing with words that may or may not have rearranged letters of other words\n",
    "> - A naive solution would be to perhaps reorder (from smallest letter to largest letter) the list/tuple/array-representation of each word uniquely and use such as keys in a dictionary and add all subsequent words to their respective keys. However, such a solution is hugely inefficient as it takes a lot of time to go through every word in the list and then reorder the letters of each word.\n",
    "> - But, the utilisation of a dictionary does seem to be the correct data structure for such a scenario as we need a method for storing a 'key' that represents particular anagrams, and then a 'value' that stores a list of the anagrams themselves. For example: (in the code below)"
