    "> Observations:\n",
    "> - Anagrams are words that can be formed by rearranging and utilising all original letters precisely once\n",
    ">   - This means that count of number for a particular letter is important \n",
    "> - We are dealing with words that may or may not have rearranged letters of other words\n",
    "> - A naive solution would be to perhaps reorder (from smallest letter to largest letter) the list/tuple/array-representation of each word uniquely and use such as keys in a dictionary and add all subsequent words to their respective keys. However, such a solution is hugely inefficient as it takes a lot of time to go through every word in the list and then reorder the letters of each word.\n",
    "> - But, the utilisation of a dictionary does seem to be the correct data structure for such a scenario as we need a method for storing a 'key' that represents particular anagrams, and then a 'value' that stores a list of the anagrams themselves. Moreover, we can even make use of the dictionary.values() function to get a list of all values for each kay. For example: (in the code below)"

    "> - Since we want to group anagrams together, then we should take into account the number of each character in each word; since there are only 26 letters in the alphabet and we're dealing with strings, then we can create a list of 26 elements all initialised to 0, each element representing the count of the number of characters\n",
    "> - We can use the ASCII values to find the indices instantaneously by taking ord(letter) - ord('a') for the index and then incrementing the integer value at that index\n",
    "> - Since we want to stick to the idea of using the dictionary, we can use the tuple representation of the list to then use as a key to the dictionary, and will also be where the strings of anagrams will then be appended"
