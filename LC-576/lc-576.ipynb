    "> - Move in star/cardinal direction fashion\n",
    ">   - Each pulsation of the star/cardination direction-wise move is a move\n",
    ">   - But if we reach a pulsation that exceeds the maxMoves, then we break out of both loops and the amount accumulated should be the amount of methods for getting out if the boundaries\n",
    "> - Of course, a counter on the # of times the ball exits the boundaries will only increment when the current_position_row < 0 or curr_pos_col < 0 or curr_pos_row > m or curr_pos_col > n; where curr_pos is just short for curr_pos\n",
    ">   - Also, if the conditions are met for incrementation, then there is no need to enqueue another pulsation\n",
    "> - We could use a queue to maintain order\n",
    "> - However, such a solution may be very computationally expensive "
