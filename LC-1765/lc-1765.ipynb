    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - All cells next to water cells are at an elevation level of one unit, while adjacent cells follow the rule of being at most one level of elevation higher\n",
    "> - With the note above, this question suggest the use of a breadth first search (BFS) solution implementation where we first find all locations of sea-level cells (water cells)\n",
    "> - Then, with inspiration from the A-star pathfinder algorithm, we move in the cardinal directions to set the sea level elevations on the matrix\n",
    "> - But of course, we do not want to overwrite any of the cells we have already visited, so we need a list to keep track of all cell locations that have been visited"

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need a list for storing visited locations \n",
    "> - We need a list to act as our queue for BFS to control when to set a particular level of elevation\n",
    "> - We first traverse the matrix to gather all the locations of the sea-level elevations (1's on the isWater matrix)\n",
    ">   - We add this location to visited and enqueue these locations to be set at a particular level of elevation\n",
    "> - Then while the queue is not empty, we move through the queue and set the height whilst also enqueuing any possible neighboring cells\n",
    ">   - We need a logical statement to decide if a particular cell should be enqueued in order to be later set with a sea-level elevation\n",
    ">   - Conditions for cell to not be enqueued:\n",
    ">       - if column is out of bounds -> col < 0 or col > num_of_columns\n",
    ">       - if row is out of bounds -> row < 0 or row > num_of_rows\n",
    ">       - if is already visited\n",
    "> - The step above is repeated till the queue is empty"
