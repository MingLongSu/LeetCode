    "> - After submission to LeetCode, the current implementation runs into the issue of a Time Limit Exceeded issue, so we now must attempt at finding a solution to make the algorithm more efficient\n",
    "> - Currently the algorithm attempts to remove all elements from the elevation_queue list; which is fine. However, we call a helper function to check if the cell is valid for determining its elevation\n",
    "> - Naively, to solve the problem, a visited list was utilised which copmrimises the space complexity, since the grid isWater is only initially filled with 1's and 0's, then there may be an implementation such that we remove the need for a visited list; that or we create a new matrix of same dims as isWater to then return as the solution\n",
    "> - Could we start by setting the water to level 0? The elevation is based on the already-set sea level elevation which can be passed as a member of the queue as well? "
