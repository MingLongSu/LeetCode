    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - For example 1, the output is true because it is opened by ( and then closed by ) which is the correct type of bracket\n",
    "> - For example 2, a similar argument to that of example 1 can be made with the string\n",
    "> - For example 3, note that the output is false since this ( is closed by this ], which is the wrong type of bracket\n",
    "> - Since the question prioritises order, particularly a last-in-first-out type of system, then we could perhaps make use of a stack data structure\n",
    "> - Let's take this example: ]{()}[\n",
    ">   - Notice that, since this ] does not have an opening bracket before it, then the string will always be invalid\n",
    ">   - Notice also that the {()} substring is valid\n",
    ">   - Perhaps what we could attempt to do is append bracket elements of a string to the stack as we traverse the string\n",
    ">   - But, if the top-most value of the stack is an opening bracket to an element of s that just so happens to also be the correct closing bracket, then we should pop the top-most value from the stack\n",
    ">   - Using this algorithm then, if the number of elements in the stack is greater than 0, then we know that the input string s is not valid, and if it is, then it is valid"

    "> ### Algorithm\n",
    "> - We need to create an array which will behave as our stack data structure\n",
    "> - As we traverse the string s, we check the following:\n",
    ">   - if the stack is not empty\n",
    ">   - if the top-most element is either (, [, or { and the current element we are at for string s is ), ], or }, respectively\n",
    ">   - if all the above is true, we should pop the top-most element. Otherwise, we should append the current element of string s\n",
    "> - Then, we return the truth value from whether the number of elements in the stack is 0, since len(stack) = 0 would mean that the input s is valid as not all brackets have been paired correctly"
